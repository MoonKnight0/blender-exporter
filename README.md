# Godot Engine's native Blender exporter add-on.

Native Godot scene format exporter for [Blender](https://www.blender.org), making the
export process to [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) as straightforward as possible.

*WARNING*: This exporter is experimental, and still lacks many features.

## Installation

1. Copy the `io_scene_godot` directory the location where Blender stores the
   scripts/addons folder on your system (you should see other io_scene_*
   folders there from other addons). Copy the entire dir and not just its
   contents.
2. Go to the Blender settings and enable the "Godot Exporter" plugin.
3. Enjoy hassle-free export.

If you find bugs or want to suggest improvements, please open an issue on the
upstream [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/blender-exporter).

## License

Enjoy using Godot....!
